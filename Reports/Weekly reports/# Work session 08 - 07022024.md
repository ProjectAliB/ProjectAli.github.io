# Work session 08 - 07/02/2024

## Overview

During this session, my work consisted of fixing the motors to the frame, as well as fixing the wheels to the already fixed motors.

## Motor fixing

After printing the last version of the support, i fixed the motor to the said support using screw-nut.

Following that, I used it to try different positions on the frame. After finding the right position, I used a marker to mark the spot where the support is to be fixed.
I used a drill to bore a whole through the marked spots, making it possible to fix the support on the frame.

## Wheel fixing

Now that the motor was fixed on the frame, it was time for wheels to be fixed to the motors.
I used a coupler connecter to connect the wheel to the motor.
Unfortunately, the connecter had smaller diameter compared to the motor's, which called for  perforation of the said piece to match our need.

All that was left was to fix the wheel to the other side of the connecter usig a screw.
