## Undertaken tasks

### Testing
I run several tests to make sure the improvement that have been made so far are perfectly functional. After making a few twists, rearranging the wiring and replacing thedefective microcontroller and bluetooth modul, the success rate has exceeded 80%, making the testing phase a success.

### Modeling the servomotor mount:
I modeled a support to mount a servomotor on the robot. The servomotor's function is to orientate the robot camera responsible for human recognition.
The servomotor will be embedded in the printed support using screw-nut system.

## Future tasks
- Complete the servomotor support modeling.
- Print the support and mount it on the robot along with the servomotor.
