# Work session 06 - 16/01/2024

## Overview

During this work session, i focused on setting the robot frame.

## Robot frame

I printed the motor support that i modeled before using a 3D printer. The results were satisfying as all the measures were right. I then moved on to place the support on what would the base of the robot. It is a rectangular wood plank 5mm in thickness and about 300mm in width and 500mm in lenth obtained using laser cutting.

However, due to the motor's considerable weight, it may be better to add a butress at each side of the support to ensure that it will not break due to the motor's weight.

## Next session's goal

Make an enhanced version of the support using butress. Test the new printed piece and fix it on the wood plank.
