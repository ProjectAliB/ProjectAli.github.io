# Work session 05 - 09/01/2024

## Overview

During the session, i focused on modeling a support to fix both my motors on the robot's chassis.

## Observation and measures

Using an available support to test multiple positions of the motor on the chassis, and taking the wheel's size into consideration, i succeded in finding the best position to place the motor. The chassis being a wood board for the time being.

However, the support used was not adapted for my personal need, which explains the reason behind the modeling of a new one. This step requires taking measures of the motor for a precise printing of the new model.

## 3D Modeling

Knowing the support shape and the motor's dimensions, i started modeling on Fusion 360. First modeling the motor which will be used as a reference for my second modeling, the support one.

## Next goal

Looking for ways to fix the wheel on the motor.
