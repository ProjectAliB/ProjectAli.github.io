# Work session 12 - 19/03/2024

## Tasks overview

- Modeling the robot on Fusion 360, along with the robot components.
- Making the wooden base using Laser-cutting machine.

## Modeling

- Using Fusion 360, 4 pieces were modeled according to their dimensions and their position:
  - The wooden base.
  - The Arduino Uno micro-controller.
  - The Jetson nano mini-computer.
  - Bread board.

## Laser cutting

- Using the sketch from the 3D modeled wooden base as a base, making the wooden base with accurate measures was a success.

## Next steps

- Look for solutions for space and wires management.
- Mount other sensors on the robot.
